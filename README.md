# Get your Grok Om!


#### [Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om/) is a clojurescript interface to the well established Facebook [React Javascript Library](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

Om provides developers with a toolkit to create reusable, composable React components and to manage the data flow (state) within and between those components.

Om is both performant and minimalistic; weighing in at ~1,000 lines of [code](https://github.com/swannodette/om/tree/master/src/om).

At the time this writing, Om is only several months old and already has almost 2,000 [Stargazers](https://github.com/swannodette/om/stargazers) on github, which  would seem to indicate it has been well received.



## This book is for you if you'd like to

* grok Om's core concepts quickly
* learn to use Om through clear examples
* create UI components that you'll want for your own projects

The first 6 chapter of this book will explain Om's basic concepts using familiar terms.

Each remaining chapter walks through the creation of a component and integrates it into an example app UI.
