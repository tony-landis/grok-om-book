# Foundation CSS Framework

The components created (mostly) make use of the [Foundation CSS](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/) framework.

The resulting collection of components benefit from the existing Foundation styling without any dependancy on the Foundation framework javascripts.

> We'll wind up with something like this, except for om instead of angular: http://madmimi.github.io/angular-foundation/


## TODO

* explain updating index.html to include foundation css

* explain updating index.html to use better cdn for reactjs
